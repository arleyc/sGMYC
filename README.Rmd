# sGMYC: GMYC analysis with subsampling

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

sGMYC runs a single-threshold GMYC analysis (Pons et al. 2006) using the splits package (Fujisawa & Barraclough 2013) with 
subsamples of sequences obtained from within the species 
delimited using all sequences. It also plots a heatmap of 
conspecificity probabilities among samples based on functions 
of the bGMYC package (Reid & Carstens 2012). When more than one tree are provided, sGMYC can implement the analysis with multiple cores using the parallel and doParallel packages.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("arleyc/sGMYC")
```
## Example: full analysis with bGMYC vs. subsampling with sGMYC

1) First, let's load an example dataset (hypotree) included with the sGMYC package:

```{r example1}
library(sGMYC)

data("hypotree")

ape::print.phylo(hypotree)
```

2) Next, we use bGMYC to implement a full Bayesian GMYC analysis:

```{r example2}
library(bGMYC)

fullgmyc<-bgmyc.singlephy(hypotree, mcmc=10000, burnin=1000, thinning=100)

#Calculate matrix of conspecificity probabilities
fullgmyc.probmat<-bGMYC::spec.probmat(fullgmyc)

# Calculate a point estimate of the number of species
length(bgmyc.point(fullgmyc.probmat,0.05))
```

3) Based on cutoff value of PP=0.05, bGMYC estimates 8 species; next, we can use a heatmap plot to display the probabilities of conspecificity:

``` {r example3}
#Plot heatmap of conspecificity probabilities
plot.bgmycprobmat(fullgmyc.probmat,hypotree)
```

4) Now, let's do subsampling with sGMYC using two samples from each of the species originally estimated with the splits package:

```{r example4}
myres<-sGMYC(hypotree,subsamp=2,nreps=100)
```

5) sGMYC estimates 2 species across all 100 subsampling replicates. We can also plot a heatmap that summarizes the variation in species limits based on subsampling:

```{r example5}
#Calculate matrix of conspecificity probabilities

myprobmat<-sGMYC::spec.probmat(myres)

#Plot heatmap of conspecificity probabilities

plot.bgmycprobmat(myprobmat,hypotree)
```

```{r example6}
#Species delimitation with subsampling using multiple trees and computer cores

#Plotting heatmap of conspecificity probabilities
```
